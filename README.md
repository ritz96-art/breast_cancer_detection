## Breast Cancer Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project that detects the presence of breast cancer in a person using classification learning algorithms like **K nearest neighbors** and **Support Vector Machine**.  
This is a beginner level machine learning project, anyone having enough understanding about the classification algorithms(KNN,SVM) can learn how the python implementations work using jupyter notebook application locally or online.
### Running Locally  
1. Install jupyterlab and then notebook  
2. Fork this repository  
3. clone your forked repo to your machine  
* git clone https://github.com/ritz96-art/breast_cancer_detection.git
4. Install dependencies  
* pip install scipy  
* pip install numpy  
* pip install matplotlib  
* pip install pandas  
* pip install sklearn
### Steps followed this project  
1. collecting data from a url address  
2. preprossing of data by replacing missing datas and feature selection
3. exploratory data analysis for better understanding of dataset  
4. modelling using train_test_split module  
5. model evaluation
