## Breast_Cancer_Detection
This repository contains a machine learning framework that detects the presence of breast cancer in a person using classification learning algorithms like **K nearest neighbors** and **Support Vector Machine**.  
This a beginner level machine learning project, anyone having enough understanding about the classification algorithms(KNN,SVM) can learn how the python implementations work using jupyter notebook application locally or online.
